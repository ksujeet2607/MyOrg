<br>
<br>
Mobile development presents a reasonably distinctive chance for a one-person development team to build an actual, usable, 
significant app end-to-end during a comparatively short period. However, mobile apps development represents more than just a 
chance for the solo-developer to create their own project as it is arguably the longer term of development, as mobile devices are 
getting larger and bigger parts of our lives.
<br>
<br>
In this post, we will take a glance at what mobile app development is, 
check a number of the major mobile platforms, and speak a bit regarding the technologies that exist for developing so 
you will have a clear idea of whether is it a good match for you or not.</p>

Technically, Android is the mobile OS with the largest most dominant share of the market with around  80% share compared to iOS's 18 % share. Those numbers are a bit deceiving since android may be a fragmented market consisting of the many different devices created by different manufacturers, running completely different versions of the Android OS.

Apple provides iOS developers with many native tools and libraries to develop iOS applications, and, though you do not have to be enforced to use Apple's development tools to create your apps, you just need to have a mac running OS X to build your application.
