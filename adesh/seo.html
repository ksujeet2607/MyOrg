SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the practice of optimizing content to be discovered through a search engine’s organic search results.

In other words, SEO meaning involves making certain changes to your website design and content that make your site more attractive to a search engine. 
You do this in hopes that the search engine will display your website as a top result on the search engine results page.


Why Does SEO Matter?
----------------------
Think about your own shopping habits. How often do you turn to Google to research a product or service?

Every second, Google processes more than 40,000 search queries. Don’t think for a moment that your customers aren’t going to Google to find their next product or service!

Need more convincing? Here are just a few of the benefits of SEO for your business:

SEO brings high-quality traffic to your website. Because your customers are searching on their terms, you can bet the links they click are ones they actually want to see. That means they’ll stick around your site longer — and have a higher chance of conversion.
SEO establishes brand awareness and trust. When your customers search on Google and find your website toward the top, they recognize your brand as a reputable authority on the topic. And when they read the helpful content on your website, they trust your business even more.
SEO is cost-effective. News flash: you don’t actually have to pay for SEO. Aside from the time and resources you choose to invest, SEO is completely free — which means you get a much higher return on investment (ROI) than many other marketing tactics.

The 3 Main Types of SEO
--------------------------
Before you can master search engine optimization, you need to know the three main types:

On-page SEO: Improving the visible parts of your website (e.g. incorporating relevant keywords, creating topical pillar pages, or publishing regular blog posts).
Off-page SEO: Improving the technical parts of your website (e.g. editing page meta descriptions, adding alt text to images, or improving site load time).
Local SEO: Combining tactics from on- and off-page SEO to increase your visibility in local search queries (e.g. updating your IP address, claiming your business listings, or responding to online reviews).
