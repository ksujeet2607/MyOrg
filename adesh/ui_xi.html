User Interface Design in Information Technology refers to the design of the user interface for software, websites or applications. 
It’s about programming the look of things, with a view to facilitating usability and to improve the user experience.

In simple terms, a user interface is the features of a device or an application that allow a user to interact with it.
Let’s say you are filling a company’s contact form on a website, your user interface, in this case, would consist of a text box, 
a drop-down list, a radio button and any other component which would allow you to enter your data into the company’s system.



User experience is all about how your website flows. Is your content in the right place? Is it naturally 
encouraging users to move to a certain goal within your site?

When building your website it is often too easy to focus on how it looks rather than how it functions.

Having someone independent review your site before it launches or even before you give it a refresh, can greatly improve your chances of conversion.
